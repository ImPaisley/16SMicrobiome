# 16S Microbiome Analyses
This repository includes the newly shortened template for the 16S microbiome analyses 
conducted within the Lake O Microbiome repository.

Changes include the creation of multiple functions, making the script "editable" (beinbg able to 
know where and what data to change in the scripts), and the addition of more comments explaining 
the processes that are going on in the script.
